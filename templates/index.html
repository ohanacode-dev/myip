                <h2>Purpose of this service</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I build various devices that I need to access remotely.
                    For this I need to know the IP address of a device.
                    This is a service to provide a simple way to keep track of devices IP address and <b><u>it is free for anyone to use.</u></b>
                    It is like a Dynamic DNS service, but you can host this anywhere, even within your local network.<br><br>
                    I do not employ a domain name registrar, nor do I provide a hosting service,
                    so I can not provide you with an domain that your devices would use directly, but just a text based record of an updated IP address.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>
                    To keep things simple, there is no login, no registration.
                    Every device using this service must have it's own unique id. We will refer to this as [device_id].
                    You can generate the id yourself. Choose any set of characters.
                    I am using a <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication">private ssh key</a>,
                    but you can use anything else you are sure is unique.<br><br>
                    On the device whose IP address you wish to keep track of make an <b>http get request</b> (or manually using your web browser) to:
                </p>
                <div class="code">https://myip.ohanacode-dev.com/set/<b>[device_id]</b></div>
                <p>On your computer, from which you wish to find devices IP address, open a web browser and go to:</p>
                <div class="code">https://myip.ohanacode-dev.com/get/<b>[device_id]</b></div><br>
                <p>This will return just your devices IP address. If your device provides a web server and you need a page to bookmark, you can use:</p>
                <div class="code">http://myip.ohanacode-dev.com/redirect_http/<b>[device_id]</b></div>
                <p>or using https if your device supports it:</p>
                <div class="code">https://myip.ohanacode-dev.com/redirect_https/<b>[device_id]</b></div>
                <p>This will provide a page redirecting to your devices IP address.</p><br>

                <h2>Opensource and free</h2>
                <p>
                    If you wish to host this service on your own network, go to the <a href="https://github.com/ohanacode-dev/myip">github page</a> and follow the instructions.
